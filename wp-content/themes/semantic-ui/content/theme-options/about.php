			<p>Theme options in Semantic UI for WordPress are stored similarly to the traditional way to store options, with one exception; All of the options are actually stored in a JSON<sup>&Dagger;</sup> string as 1 database value (rather than each as a seperate database row). Storing information like this is ideal because it means you can store multi-layer arrays as-is in the database.</p>
			<p><sup>&Dagger;</sup> Since there are few cases where the extra features of <code>serialize()</code> are needed, and the JSON encode/decode functions <a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/804045/preferred-method-to-store-php-arrays-json-encode-vs-serialize">are about twice as fast</a>; a JSON string is the default storage method.</p>

			<p>I'm someone who believes the best things in life are free, and that code (no matter how well done) is no exception.</p>
			<p>Everything I develop is meant to be shared and used by other people; when I code, I try and be mindful of what others would think. This means I always do my best to keep my code easy to read and understand.</p>
